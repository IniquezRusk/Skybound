# Skybound
2D Arcade survival scroller, shoot the asteroids to gain points. Avoid them and see how long you can survive!
The file you want to run will be skybound.exe, that is how you can access the game.
Code is all open source if you are interested in seeing it.
This was made in SDL2, no engine was made. This took a really long time for me to complete, this was my first ever arcade shooter I have made. Hope you like it! 
I am interested in learning more about coding in general, you may message me for criticism.
